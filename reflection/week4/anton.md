## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to get better at creating vertical user stories, and better at explaining to members of team how to think when creating them. Because I think that is something all of us could get better at. I am sure we are going to understand this matter better towards the end of the course. I think it helps to have a clear vision of what we want the user story to include, and what we need the application to be.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I don't think I have much more to say about this, this week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I suggested that our team should try and make use of pull requests and perform code review on each others PRs. I thought this would be positive because on previous sprints we did let a few slipups through. And when we employed this strategy during the latest sprint it did give rise to a few discussions which in the end resulted in a better product, I think at least. Though we want to make a few changes. We didn't have time to review some PRs that were made during the end of the week. Sometimes it also became a bit confusing when PRs where made before they were actually done, and got reviews too early. So we are going to be more organized for next sprint.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I worked on the frontend and timeline view for the events.
