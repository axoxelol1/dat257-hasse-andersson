# Axel Larsson - Week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get familiar with the .ics calendar format both for parsing gasquens calendar and then also potentially exporting our own calenar.
I will learn this if I take on the user stories relevant to the format.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The main thing we can continue doing is working in groups and pair/programming.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been participating in all parts of the scrum cycle and am mostly happy with the team's use of scrum.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have been responsible for a user story for parsing facebook events, which took the whole week. I also contriubted to hte team reflection. Last
week I contributed to the same things.
