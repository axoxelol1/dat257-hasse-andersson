# Week 4 personal reflection - Casper Lindh

## what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I want to further develop my knowledge in front-end-development and get to know more about how to work with tailwind. More specifically I want to learn how to code and structure typescript documents and maybe some CSS. 

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
From last week’s reflection “I believe that I can contribute by appraising different ideas and functions which can be integrated to the project. Further I believe that my knowledge in management can come in handy as we may face problematics i.e., in relation to which user-stories to be prioritized and how we should work as a team efficiently.” Other than that, as a scrum master I believe that I can contribute more knowledge about agile workflow by consequently implementing scrum in the developing process. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Now I’ve been crowned as a scrum master and felt like it has contributed to deeper knowledge about how to pursue an agile workflow. We’ve had some daily scrum meeting and all group members have been able to participate and contribute to scrum overall.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week my contribution towards the team deliveries has been aiding in the development of a timeline-view of events, to the best of my knowledge. As well as identifying, creating, and defining user-stories to completing them and logging the progress continuously.
