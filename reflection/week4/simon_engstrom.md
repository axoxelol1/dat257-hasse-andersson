# Weekly reflection W3 - Simon Engstr√∂m 

## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
This week have been mainly about setting up a typescript interface for the events and setting up automated build testing for every push to the online repository. Before and during the sprint I've been working with typescript and backend/fronend development in a similar environment to advance my knowledge which I feel has come to use. Next week I would like to focus more on contributing to the frontend. I'll do this by trying to assign myself a frontend user story. I feel like my skills in time and effort estimation have been pretty good this week. I'll continue to work on it next week.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I feel like I have been able to contribute with my git knowledge to help the others work with all the features git and github provides.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
I've been creating and finishing user-stories as well as reviewing other user stories before merging them to the sprint branch. I feel like I've done my part.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
Last week we had a team reflection/review session where we all took part in discussion to establish a document of our thoughts. I feel like we all contributed equally with opinions although not everyone actually wrote in the document. I can improve in this area, and I'll try to do so this week.
