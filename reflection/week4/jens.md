## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
What I'd like to learn better is the ability to smoothly learn new techniques related to software engineering. Some examples of that would be the ability to efficiently adapt new programing languages with the learning curve being more steep. I also wish to get better knowledge of how different languages and techniques can be combined in order to maximize the value. So far I've learned a lot in how software workers actually work in for instance github, vscode etc. I still have plenty to learn in creating efficient workflows/platforms, but as soon as I do so I believe that my skills will develop quickly.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? ##
By encourage openness and conversation, I hope to convey the team to communicate in a way which is easily accesible. By this I mean to communicate in a way so that both team members and/or other stakeholders can recieve and understand things that are being communicated without losing any information. I'm positive I can help my team mates structurinig the project in for instance setting up goals and minor milstones which are feasible with respect to deadlines etc.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? ##
I played a big part in creating user stories and making sure that they remained within our time frame. I ensured everyone had tasks and also that support could be provided for the tasks. When the issues I was responsible was done i reached out and offered support to others who weren't done with their user stories as of yet. Finally I've communicated to the team members that we had certain deadlines approaching, in other words making sure we were on track with  our planning.


## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? ##
I was responsible of two user stories:
- "As a delevoper, I'd like to know what relevant committees there are and also pictures for each of them" 
- As a developer, I want to have a specified API, so that I can make my contribution integrate well with the rest of the product"
For the first one I gathered information on what committees should be included on our site and also to gather pictures of them. As for the second one I acted as a sounding board to come up with an API that would be easily integrated with the rest of the program. After the user story branches were completed I help in pull-requesting them and also merging them into the rest of the sprint.
