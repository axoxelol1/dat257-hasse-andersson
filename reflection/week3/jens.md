## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
I wish to further develop my knowledge in using a wide variety of different tools in order to create software. In previous courses we haven't used much more than a text editor or compiler when programming, but so far in this project there have been a lot more previously 
unknown tools that have been used. What I wish to learn is how different tools all come along and more so why different tools are to prefer.
I wish to extend my knowledge not only in object-oriented programming and databases, but also learn new categories and how these can be connected.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? ##
Like I mentioned in previous reflections, I hope that my experience in project management come in handy. Furthermore, once we have our set up completely ready, I want to help my team mates with specific details in the programming-parts of the project. Once I have had the time to investigate technical details, I'd like to share my newly developed knowledge with the rest of the team. 

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? ##
We had our first sprint this week, where I actively participated. I played a part in creating user stories as well as epics and also deciding on time frame and DOD for them. I also actively participated in delegating certain user stories to certain epics. What I kept in mind was trying to be realistic with our sprint, in other words making sure the backlog wouldn't be to extensive. I also took part in the execution, making sure that all four of our five user stories were completed

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? ##
I played a active part in creating some of our deliveries, for example;
-"As a student, I want to see an event when I visit the siite, so that I know about the next event I can go to".
For this story, I contributed by having input on the design as well as writing code for the "Card". Other than that, I arranged team meetings and developed a plan for the next steps.
