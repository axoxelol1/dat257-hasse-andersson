# Axel Larsson - Week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have decided to use tailwind so I will be spending some time setting up a own little hobby project using next and tailwind during the weekend/holiday
to practice that. I will also do some API querying in this project so that I can practice that, as I have not done much frontend.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
It has been hard this week since I have been in France but I am hoping to do some good pair programming once we come back after the easter break.
I have looked at querying mongoDB through nextJS API routes and will share what I have learnt next meeting.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Unfortunately I haven't been able to directly contribute to this much, but I have read our user stories and epcis and am trying to get a better grasp
of what makes a user story good. I hope once I attend a supervision session after easter that I can contribute even more.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have contributed by looking at mongoDB/nextJS integration and testing it out. I have also given input for the team reflection.
