## what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to gain more knowledge about the different components revolving developing front-end as well as back-end in website programming. Further I want to learn how to model and structure websites. I haven’t previously programmed a website from scratch and feel very intrigued to learn more about specifically website design, but also as mentioned interested to learn about functionalities in relation to programming a website.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Following previous reflections, I believe that I can contribute by appraising different ideas and functions which can be integrated to the project. Further I believe that my knowledge in management can come in handy as we may face problematics i.e., in relation to which user-stories to be prioritized and how we should work as a team efficiently. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
The use of scrum has officially started full-scale as this week has been our first sprint. I’ve contributed by creating user-stories, epics and throughout the week completing various tasks and thus after a while completing user-stories and annotating on our scrum-board. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution towards the team deliveries extends from identifying, creating and defining user-stories to completing them and logging the progress continuously.
