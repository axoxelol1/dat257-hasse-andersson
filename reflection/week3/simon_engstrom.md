# Weekly reflection W3 - Simon Engstr√∂m 

## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
Since I have not been able to contribute a lot this sprint either because me and Axel are abroad, I have only created one user story after we already established the first sprint, so I cannot say that my skills in time/effort estimation has improved. The goal remains to sprint 2. I have done some web development this week seperately to the course work that I feel can benefit me in this course. I will continue to work on this in the coming days and weeks to maximize how much I can learn.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
As said last week I have not been able to physically contribute a lot to the knowledge of my peers since I'm abroad, but I hope I can next week.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
I have created a user story this week and participated in using the scrum board to finalize tasks and user stories. I'll continue to do this next week and I am looking forward to being able to contribute to the sprint planning more.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
I have shared my thoughts in the team reflection this week, other than that we have not had any deliveries. Generally I think I can contribute more to the project as a whole as I mentioned last week, so the goal remains to sprint 2.
