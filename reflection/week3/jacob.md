# Reflection week 3 - Jacob Bengtsson

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
**What I am doing**: We implemented a design library called Tailwind css, and I want to learn that better.

**What I should be doing**: Along with tailwind I need to work on my React competence.

**How I get there**: I read about tailwind on their website.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
**What I am doing**: I showed how you can design a component in React to some of the group members.

**What I should be doing**: I think that was a good idea because it helped us reach our sprint goal, and those student can now work more independently.

**How I get there**: I will always be available for more help if it is needed.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
**What I am doing**: I helped make sure our user stories were finished on time.

**What I should be doing**: Complete the sprint goals.

**How I get there**: I did the right thing I feel.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
**What I am doing**: I helped setup the group's workspace, with Next.js.

**What I should be doing**: My part of this week's sprint.

**How I get there**: I did my part so I think I'm on the right track still.
