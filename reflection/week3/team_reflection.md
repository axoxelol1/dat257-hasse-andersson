# Hasse Andersson team reflection - Week 3 / Sprint 1

## Customer Value and Scope
We have not produced much customer value yet as this sprint was mostly setting up our development environment. We have a meeting planned with our external stakeholder to further specify what is valuable. We are happy with the github projects feature. Some of our effort estimations were wrong but overall they were good.

KPIs:
- The amount of user stories that were substantially wrongly estimated per sprint. We chose this KPI so that we are forced to reflect more about our effort estimations as a team and improve our estimations.
- Total points for user stories completed per sprint. We chose this KPI because it gives us a rough estimate about how much work we got done.
- Perceived value per sprint. We chose this KPI to complement the one above so that we can see that what we are doing are actually doing valuable work.

We intend to use these in order to further develop and reflect over the progress made by the team. Comparing these KPIs will provide a better overview of how work is correlated to perceived value by stakeholder/product-owner. This will hopefully lead to better sprint planning and quantification of user-stories. 

## Social Contract and Effort
We had two team members who were on vacation so it was more difficult to work together. Because of this we planned a smaller sprint and spent less time on the course than we intend to do in future sprints. We have updated our social contract to reflect on our new communication through discord.
