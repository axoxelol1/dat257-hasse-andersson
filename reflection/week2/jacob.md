# Reflection week 2 - Jacob Bengtsson

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
**What I am doing**: What I want to learn haven't changed much from last week, I'm interested to see how the agile workflow will work in our group.

**What I should be doing**: I think I'm doing the right things.

**How I get there**: So I don't need to change anything.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
**What I am doing**: I went to a React workshop this week in my free time which I think will help in our project.

**What I should be doing**: I think I should try to help the others in the group to also get some of that knowledge.

**How I get there**: I tell them what I learned at the workshop.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
**What I am doing**: I've been thinking about different user stories we can implement in our first sprint that begins soon. I have also prepared the Github repository for the Scrum workflow.

**What I should be doing**: I'm not entirely sure if you should come up with issues/user stories during the sprint or before it.

**How I get there**: I should have asked a question about that during today's Q&A, but I think you come up with the user stories in the sprint.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
**What I am doing**: I made a sketch of the program in Figma together with Anton. I also prepared the Github repository for the scrum workflow.

**What I should be doing**: We assigned different parts of this week's deliverables to each group member and I feel I have done my part.

**How I get there**: I did my part so I think I'm on the right track at the moment.
