# Reflection week 2 - Axel Larsson
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to learn more about working with as a scrum team. I hope it will become more clear once we 
start with our sprints. I would say that is my main objective
for the whole course, since learning new technologies is relatively easy to do on my own but I need a
team to learn scrum/agile. I have looked at react and nextJS and
feel like I have a good enough understanding to start creating a product with it. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
Since I will be in France during the next week it might be hard, but I feel like linking good documentation
and possibly some pair programming is a good way to help those who have less experience with the
technologies we will be using.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
After the exercise lecture during this week I feel like I have a better understanding of what kind of
user stories we can create, so I will be thinking about some reasonable stories that could end up being a part
of our board.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We had a meeting were we worked together on the business model canvas, 
I also helped with some ideas for the visual mockup.
