## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
I would like to learn more how to set up a sofisticated workspace, used in professional circumstances. 
I'm also interested in developing the project that we're about to create,

 of the application. Other than hard knowledge I would also like more experience of how to develop on large projects with a group, since it is a scenario that I will face later in life. Also, I think I will learn how to estimate the time certain tasks will take, which is an important skill to master in software development, since bad estimation can lead to being overwhelmed and demoralized.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? ##
Since I've taken part in project development before, I hope I can bring lots of insightful perspectives on that matter.
I'd like to help my team members excel in communcating with stakeholders and presenting things which adds value. In doing this
the aim should be to solving a need which is desired.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? ##
None as of yet, since we haven't had our first sprints yet. But when the times comes I hope to bring lots of useful efforts.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? ##
I mainly contributed by taking somewhat of a leading role when we created our business model canvas.
Unfortunately I had a busy week, not leaving much time left for this course. But I attended the meetings that I could, and I'm hoping to make up for the
time I missed coming weeks.
