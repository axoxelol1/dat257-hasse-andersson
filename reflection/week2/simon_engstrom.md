# Weekly reflection W2 - Simon Engstr√∂m 

## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
Since we have not actually started developing on the project yet my learning goals remain the same regarding both hard and soft skills. That is developing my skills in web development and teamwork in projects like this.
Some of us have started to mock up some user stories for next weeks sprint in the trello and labeled them with their size estimation. I'll try to do this more next week to sharpen my time estimation skills, and evaluate the size and time required to finish the user stories I take on next week in regards to their label.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
As said last week I think I can share knowledge in web development since I have some experience. We did have a short rundown of the core functionality of git earlier this week, where I could've contributed but I was at home sick, so sadly I could not in an effective manner.

This might be a problem next week aswell since I will be in France.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
As said earlier some members have started to create som user stories for the first sprint next week. We are all pretty much in sync with what these are although I wish I had been more involved in the process of creating these, which might be due to me being at home for much of the week to avoid spreading my cold to other people. I will keep this in mind next week, and as I said earlier I will try to create more user stories and contribute to the scrum board next week to contribute to the team and to my personal knowledge. I feel like I can contribute more if I can actually physically attend school and meetings.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
This week we created a small mockup och the interface where I remotely contributed with some final touches and we all as a team filled out and contributed with opinions and ideas for the business model canvas. So I feel like I've done my part, although I want to contribute more for next week since I feel like I can be more involved if I can physically attend meetings on campus.
