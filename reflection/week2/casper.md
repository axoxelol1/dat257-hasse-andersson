# Casper Lindh - Reflection week 2
## what do I want to learn or understand better? 
This week I learned more about how to structure a project and how value can be perceived by a user. What I further want to learn is how to implement this in code. Learn more about what goes into website programming. Also, learn more about how to use scrum efficiently and it’s underlying components. 

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I believe I can contribute with my knowledge in value perception. I believe it can benefit the team in the process in creating user stories and how they may be evaluated. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum? 
My contribution in the use of scrum is to is within the group propose ideas of structure, when and where to conduct meeting and how we possibly could proceed in the future. Still, it has the “scrumming” has not really begun to very influential in the way we operate, but I believe that will change in the upcoming weeks. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
My main contribution is relating to creating the business model canvas, since I attend the industrial economics program at Chalmers. Further I’ve been involved in both planning and attending to meetings and feel like the group dynamic is starting to pick up pace.
