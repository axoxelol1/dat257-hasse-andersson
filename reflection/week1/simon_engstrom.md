# Weekly reflection W1 - Simon Engstr√∂m #

## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
Our idea as of now is to make a website that aggregates information from several different endpoints concerning activities on campus. To me this idea is brilliant and I think that there is a lot of potential for me to learn about different web technologies and getting used to creating applications using them. I'll of course do this by trying to engage myself with all of the parts of the application. Other than hard knowledge I would also like more experience of how to develop on large projects with a group, since it is a scenario that I will face later in life. Also, I think I will learn how to estimate the time certain tasks will take, which is an important skill to master in software development, since bad estimation can lead to being overwhelmed and demoralized.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
As said the aim is to create a web application, which involves a certain amount of networking and probably, further down the line, containerization and deployment which I have previous experience with. I think can contribute to the team by sharing my knowledge about this at that stage.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
Since we haven't actually started any sprints yet, nothing. Although I plan to share my knowledge with the others once it becomes relevant, since I have taken a course that involved using scrum and agile development. I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge and increasing my experience in this course.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
We haven't hade any deliveries yet other than the social contract, which we all created together with the help of an article about the topic. On a more general note, I have been present at meetings with the group where we created the social contract and discussed project ideas, where I contributed with my idea which was technically very similar to the one we ended up with. Later in the week I fell ill and couldn't participate on fridays lecture, but my group was kind enough to fill me in remotely afterwards.
