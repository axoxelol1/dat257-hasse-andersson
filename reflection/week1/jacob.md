# Reflection week 1 - Jacob Bengtsson

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn to work in a group and to deliver a complete project in a relatively short amount of time. I also want to learn to build a full-stack application and learn to use React.
The course is about working on a project within a time frame, and our project will be a full-stack web application, with React as the front-end framework.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We are looking at developing a web application, which I have some previous experience in. Hopefully I can help other members there. 
I hope that I can learn new things during this project so I can be even more helpful in the future.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Currently nothing, since we haven't started our Scrum process, and I think that is as it should be.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed an idea for a project which all project members were on board with.
I think it's good that we within the first week already have picked a project.
