# Anton Ekström - Reflection week 1

## what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to work effectively within a team. I also want to become better at developing on large projects, by dividing the work and not taking on larger tasks than I can handle. Right now, my hobby projects have a tendency to grow in complexity quite quickly, until I create a new project and begin from scratch. I often try to stay organized to begin with, but I don't think I have the right tools and strategies to keep it up for very long. I believe that the experience alone from participating in the course will help me grow considerably and become better at the things described earlier. I would like to document my thought process and lessons that I find valuable, because I think this would aid me in this matter.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think that my previous experience of working with web technologies which the other team members are not very familiar with will allow me to help them and accelerate their learning process by providing support. To achieve this I think that it is important to initially set up the project as a group so that everyone feels comfortable with the project. I also think that programming in pairs to begin with, perhaps during the first sprint, would be beneficial.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We have not begun a sprint yet and therefore we have not done a lot of scrumming.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have contributed by being present during all our meetings and taking part in our discussions. I think my experience with hobby project has helped our team by being able to provide somewhat educated guesses on some technical matters. Other than that, we have not done a lot yet aside from coming up with a project idea and writing our social contract.
