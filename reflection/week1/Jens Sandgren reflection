# Anton Ekström - Reflection week 1

## what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to work on collaborative effort between multiple members to achieve a solid project. 
What I also look forward to is to be a part of and create something which adds value to the stakeholder(s).
What this means for me is to provide something which actually is useful, whereas previous IT-work has only been in educational purposes.
Finally I'd wish to excel my software capabilities and team collaboration skills.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Hopefully I'm able to contribute with my project managing skills. I feel confident in my sense of the greater picture,
which will come in handy when bringing all the pieces together. I'm used to being involved in various consulting projects with stakeholders,
therefor making my sense for structure and results valuable for my team mates. Being from Industrial engineering, helps me in
understanding what brings value which I turn hope to convey to my team mates.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Though we haven't started scruming, if feel like my methodology when it comes to working processes and reflections will bring value
to my team mates.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The way I've contributed thus far is by actively participating in group meetings and making sure everyone is onboard what our
situation is and what our actions are intended for. I've also contributed by making sure that we have an agenda with our meetings
and to making sure we accomplish the things we have as our goals in the meetings.
