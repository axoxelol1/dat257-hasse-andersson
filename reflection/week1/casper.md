Casper Lindh - Reflection week 1
what do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn more about working in a team towards a common goal in project-based approach. Further, I would like to learn the basics of website programming with its underlying components as well as to be part of the development and understand what goes in to creating a website for a stakeholder and to fulfil their interests.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Personally, I believe as one who hasn’t programmed a lot on my spare time the contribution is not directly going to be related to solving abstract programming problem. But instead, be more about having a comprehensive understanding of how components should work together and contribute more on how to create value for a user. Also contribute by appraising different ideas and functions which can be integrated to the project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My contributing relating to the use of Scrum is non-existent at the moment since we haven’t started using it yet, but I’ve read a bit about it so when we start with the project for real, I’m certain that I can contribute.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Until now, we have just stipulated what the project will be about, and we’ve all engaged in discussion and brainstorming of ideas, and I’ve contributed with my opinion and interest of creating a website. I’m exited for what is in store for this course!
