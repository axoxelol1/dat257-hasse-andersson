# Reflection week 1 - Axel Larsson
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since it is only the first week of the course there are still a lot of unkowns but I am looking forward 
to getting a clearer picture of what working with a software project in a structured way looks like. I am also
looking forward to learning some some new technologies like Nextjs.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Right now I feel like a priority is to make sure everyone is comfortable with git and github. 
I will spend some time looking for good git learning resources.
I have previously set up a backend for a website and can hopefully use that experience to help teach the group.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
During our first meeting we discussed how we want to do checkups and when we should
schedule meetings. Since we have not actually started working on the project yet it is hard to
do much more than that.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I helped write the social contract together with the rest of the group.
We also discussed project ideas.
