# Axel Larsson - Week 8

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to continue learning about new technologies as it has been really fun and challenging during this course.
I also want to keep improving my front-end skills. To do both these things I will continue coding hobby-projects.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I am not sure how much I can help other this week but Jens and Casper are good at writing reports so I hope they can teach me.
Not related to this course but I will probably help some team members learn math next week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have particiapted in standup meeting. We continue to have sprint reviews and retrospectives that I am also taking an active part in.
I don't feel there is much more I can do without being scrum master, which only one person can be.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I am happy with my contribution, this week I have been on top of pull requests and reviewing code thouroughly as soon as I have time.
This way other team members can get their PRs merged faster.
I want to continue helping which I can do by participating in the final presentation and wrinting the final report.
