## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
This week my priority is to compile a high quality report. Although I've written many reports previously, I haven't done so in IT-related project. So what I'd like to learn is to efficiently make us of IT-terms appropriately in that context. I still want to improve my software skills, and this course has even further sparked that interest. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I can make use of my previous knowledge in report writing and learn others from my experiences. I also have the ability to reflect well on work I've done, which I hope to convey to my team mates

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
Like previous weeks I've actively participated in setting up the sprint in terms of user stories and goals. I also participated well during our stand-up scrum but also during our sprint review/reflection. 

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
This week I helped in finishing one of the user stories. This one was related to implementing a logo on all sites of our webbsites but also to have a link connected to it. But my major contribution has been to write the report, and I've done so successfully thus far.
