## Customer Value and Scope
We have managed to complete the last feature we wanted to include which was an admin page for managing users. Other than that we have done polishing and bug fixing which also improves value. By focusing on the MVP and what provides the most value for the product, we’ve done a successful job in prioritizing the most important things. This has been done in accordance with the stakeholder. We are happy with our success as we feel we have reached the learning goals in the course and our teamwork has worked well this week. It is also great that we managed to finish the application, aside from some minor bugs.

The way we’ve developed the structures of user stories has been rather successful towards the end of the project. Acceptance criterias are more robust and prevent us from adding the code/functionality that doesn’t meet the right quality. By having the acceptance criterias in play it enables us to more rigorously break down the main task into smaller tasks, enabling top-down problem solving. By thoroughly breaking down tasks, it creates a better understanding of what the finished story should enable and accomplish. This results in us as a group to more accurately estimate tasks but also to create value that is wished for.

When a team member creates a pull request the reviewers check that it has fulfilled the acceptance criteria for the user story. The quality of user story acceptance criteria has been great this week, possibly because we had very few user stories as we were mostly fixing bugs this week.

During this and the previous sprint our KPIs have shown that we have greatly improved at estimating effort compared to earlier in the course. Our two KPIs that cover estimation have been helpful but we have not been able to use our stakeholder perceived value KPI in order to improve in a meaningful way.

## Design decisions and product structure

This week we have not made many design decisions since it has mostly been about wrapping up the last parts of the project. However it still feels like our previous design decisions were sound because they have not caused any problems for us.

Our technical documentation has improved as the project has progressed. The reason for this being is to have it more presentable for others seeing it. During the project team members have gotten a good understanding of how the application works, but as we approach hand-in there is a great need of enabling others to get that understanding. Our readme has been updated with information about project structure and technologies used. We still want to improve the section covering project setup.

During our sprints we have accumulated a number of bugs. We spent this week fixing some bugs, which was beneficial for the code quality. We might have to spend more time fixing bugs, and refactoring some parts of the project in order to prevent future bugs. The number of bugs we get may otherwise accelerate over time.
