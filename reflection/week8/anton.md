## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand better how git merging strategies work, because I am often confounded by how git could not resolve some conflicts by itself. I know there are a number of great resources on the web for learning git, so I can look into one of these.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
If I were to write better comments and descriptions in my code, commits and other messages I think that would make it easier for other to understand and learn from my code.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week, I think I have become a little better at doing my tasks earlier in the week. This way, we were able to have better discussions about the changes, before the sprint deadline.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I added buttons for copying a link and exporting the calendar file from the site. The exported calendar also uses the same filtering options as the site currently has.
