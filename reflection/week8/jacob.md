# Reflection week 8 - Jacob Bengtsson

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
**What I am doing**: This week I learned a bit more on how to structure code between the backend and the frontend.

**What I should be doing**: We ran into some issues when merging branches with conflicts resulting in unexpected things changing in other unrelatead components. For example, we changed so our filter window should be closed, but after some merging it turned out it was open again. This and similar issues can probably be avoided with unit tests in the future.

**How I get there**: By reading up more on testing.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
**What I am doing**: This week I helped the team with finding the issues on the page and adding them to the backlog.

**What I should be doing**: We found many issues but a lot of them didn't get finished, and that might not have happened if we got better at assigning them.
  We started this week by saying that people will assign issues to themselves during the sprint, but people didn't do that.

**How I get there**: In future projects I will try to make sure everything in the backlog is assigned to at least one person. This person could assign this to someone else if they don't have time. But I think more issues will be finished if the issues actually are assigned.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
**What I am doing**: I helped come up with and prioritize our most relevant bugs and issues to make sure we have a finished product at the end of the sprint.

**What I should be doing**: I should have been better at making sure our issues were assigned to people. That would likely have increased our throughput.

**How I get there**: By discussing with the team how we assign issues.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
**What I am doing**: I finished a small feature with adding and removing users, but mostly fixed some smaller bugs and issues this week.

**What I should be doing**: In the future I want to have a more evenly distributed workflow, this week I did all my work on one long evening.
  And in general, in the future I want to spend more time planning the project as a whole as well as planning each sprint and the stories more carefully. I think that would improve the workflow.

**How I get there**: The next time I do a project I will spend a lot more time researching, thinking and planning.
