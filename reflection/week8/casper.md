# Week 8 personal reflection - Casper Lindh

## what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I learned to make alterations to already existing functionalities in order to make it more user-friendly. What I further want to learn for future projects is to gain more knowledge about the framework we’ve done our developing in. More specifically, I want to learn more about how to use an api and how to connect front-end to back-end in a more intuitive way.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
For this week I’ve helped explained how to make use of anchoring for a component i.e., so that links can be used to access other parts of the website. I’ve also helped by contributing with my skills in report writing to make things more easily understandable for my team members as well as utilizing alternative cost to best benefit the team.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As a scrum master I contributed by conducting and leading scrum-meetings in order for the group to become more aware of the current situation of the project and to ensure an agile workflow. More specifically conducted and led sprint review, sprint retrospective, sprint planning and two standup scrum meetings.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I’ve imported a package to the site to better structure and make use of links on different components to make a more easy and user-friendly experience. I’ve also started on writing the final report and come quite far.
