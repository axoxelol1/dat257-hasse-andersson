# Weekly reflection W4 - Simon Engstr√∂m 

## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
I feel satisfied with my knowledge as of now. I guess I could get some more understanding of what to write in the report.
As of now only two team member has started with it. I'll do this by reading in and parttaking in the process.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I don't know as of now. This was the last sprint so we won't work that much on implementing new features now. Only bug fixing.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
I've taken on userstories and bugs and solved them in the sprint. I feel like I could've done more though.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
Same as last week but I can parttake more with writing the actual report now. I plan on doing this next week.
