# Axel Larsson - Week 6

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand the login system so that we can use it in other parts of the website. I will talk to Jacob.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I want to help Jacob understand merge conflicts and package-lock.json. I will take a look at it with him at the same time that we are looking at his
login system.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I am still parttaking in all our meetings and reflections. This week we have decided to schedule at least 2 stand up meetings during the week which I will
participate in. 

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I am taking part in writing our team reflection during our sprint retrospective. I implemented a calendar view for the project and helped Simon
finish his editing user story through some pair programming.
