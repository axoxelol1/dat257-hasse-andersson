# Hasse Andersson team reflection - Week 6 / Sprint 4

## Design decisions and product structure
We’ve chosen to have three endpoints of data. We parse event pages from facebook and store in a database, fetch events from gasquens API, as well as offering the functionality for admin users to add and edit events manually in a dashboard page. This makes sure that the information displayed on the page is relevant, and the manual editing opportunities assures quality of the information.

We do not have much technical documentation aside from our readme that specifies how to set up the project. Last time we reflected over comments in our code and that we need to be sure to look at that when reviewing pull requests. This is still something we need to work on and some code needs to be gone through and documented.

Continuous integration and eslint have run automatically on all pull requests. The automated testing of builds makes it easy to see at a glance if a pull request compiles and runs without having to run it on a local machine. The use of eslint has helped reduce unnecessarily complex code and writing poor code.

We ensure code quality and standards by having at least two other members to approve user stories as they are being Pull-requested. As of now we are also figuring about ways to create components that are easily reusable. We need to decide on UI standards to create an uniformal design on the website.


## Application of Scrum
The different roles in the project have been assigned in a satisfactory way. The scrum master ensures that the application of scrum is being followed and that all major subjects are being touched on. The product owner has done a great job in communicating with the stakeholder. This has ensured that we’re delivering on schedule and so that we target our efforts in a way that creates customer value. One thing that has been discovered is that without the communication between stakeholder and PO, there would have been a risk for us to deliver functions that aren’t requested, or at least not prioritized. Besides these two roles, other team members has been supportive to the two previously mentioned roles

Pull requests have been used in a more standardized way now, team members are putting in pull requests when they are done with their user stories and want to be approved for merge. Team members are also getting better at properly looking at requests and giving helpful feedback if needed. 

We’ve discovered the need of having more continuous feedback during the sprints. For this reason, we’ve decided to have another half-sprint meeting, which has helped us to either assign new tasks if the goals have been met or to aid those who still have stories left. It has helped our understanding of how each work affects others, and by this half-time meeting we’ve found ways to work more efficiently. In the upcoming week we will schedule a few stand up meetings as well.

Our application of scrum is taking place according to literature and user-stories are created by following INVEST-criterias. The supervision has also provided insights which has helped our working procedures.
