## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I pretty much know everything at this point.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We continued as we've done previous weeks with starting the week by meeting at school and beginning with our user stories. I think this is a good thing, because getting started is often the most difficult part, so it is helpful to have someone else there who can help. I think it is easiest for me to help others when we are physically at the same place, so our meetings are beneficial in that way as well.

This week we also started having quick 15 minute standup-scrum-meetings over discord (digital voice communications). This was nice because we had the opportunity to tell each other if we are having any problems with our tasks, and also to get updated on what the others are doing. This was a good addition which I think we should continue with.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I performed code reviews, participated during meetings, took part in conversations and worked on user stories. I have also created new user stories.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I made a new API route that sends a calendar file that the user can import into their own calendar.
