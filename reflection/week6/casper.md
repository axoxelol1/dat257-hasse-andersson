# Week 6 personal reflection - Casper Lindh

## what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I’ve continued to build upon front-end development. I feel like front-end is something that is both time consuming and confusing at times where things sometimes end up where they’re not supposed to. Now I have started to get a feel for the basics and can orient myself somewhat confidently. This week I want to get more knowledge of functionalities which can be implemented on the site, as well as continue develop knowledge in managing the team to work agile.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week I feel like I’ve gotten to pass knowledge I gained from others forward to one of my group members, since we co-developed a user story. What I helped with was in front-end development mostly related to css and tailwind functionalities. Further I will contribute as mentioned in previous chapters.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As a scrum master I contributed by conducting and leading scrum-meetings in order for the group to become more aware of the current situation of the project and to ensure a agile workflow. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I’ve developed a “pop-up” window where student and committees can login in to the site, since we want the functionality where events can be added directly to the site, as well as an administrator account so events and other stuff stored in the backend can be modified without having to directly access the database.
