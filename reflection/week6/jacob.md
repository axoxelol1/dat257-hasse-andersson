# Reflection week 6 - Jacob Bengtsson

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
**What I am doing**: I learned a lot about password, security, authentication and authorization.
This took a lot of time but I think it will pay dividends in the future in future projects.
I also improved my time management a bit from last week. I delivered my user story not as late as last week, still this can get better.

**What I should be doing**: I need to get better at estimating my user stories and setting clear acceptance criteria to avoid feature creep.

**How I get there**: I will look over the stories I pick carefully before the sprint starts to make sure the stories are well defined.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
**What I am doing**: I now know more about security, passwords and authentication.

**What I should be doing**: I can help people utilize the system I created, and maybe create a service for it.

**How I get there**: I will think over how I structured my code.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
**What I am doing**: I reviewed my team mates code, same as last week. I helped prioritize our user stories to try to maximize stakeholder value.
I attented our two meetings.

**What I should be doing**: I feel our scrum work is going great.

**How I get there**: I feel I'm in a good spot at the moment.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
**What I am doing**: I made a secure login system from scratch, so there was a lot of time spent learning.

**What I should be doing**: My part of this week's sprint, which this was.

**How I get there**: I did my part so I think I'm on the right track still.
