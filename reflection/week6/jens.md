## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
I want to improve my knowledge in creating the hollistics of the website. As of now, the UI is somewhat inconsistent when it comes to the design of components etc. I'd also like to become more efficient when developing new code, since it takes quite some time for me to do so. Eventhough we've become better and better each week at the application of scrum, but I also feel like we could have our sprint review and retrospectives more efficient. Our agenda isn't that clear before these stages, so I'd like to better in improving this for our team. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I feel like I'm able to contribute and learn others to focus on our MVP and deliverables. We have a lot of ideas with things to be implemented on the site, but since the time of the project is starting to run out we need to be focused on the MVP and have something shippable. This is one of the instances where I can help the team. 

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
As well as in previous weeks, I helped a lot in review, doing the retrospective and planning next sprint. I also took the initiative to suggest more check-ins and follow ups during the sprint. I also helped in setting up deadlines and proceedures on when and how to do the merges of both the user stories and the branch. Also, I attend and actively participated during all our meetings.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
I contributed by successfully deliver on the user story I was assigned to. I also encouraged all my team mates with their user stories, providing support in all instances I could.
