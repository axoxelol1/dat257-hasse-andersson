# Weekly reflection W3 - Simon Engstr√∂m 

## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
This week I have done more frontend work like I wished for and I really feel like my skills improved from what I've done this week. I had to do some backend aswell and had to do some different things there aswell that I hadn't done before which I learned from aswell. All in all a really giving week. I think I'd still want to do more frontend work since I feel there is room to improve the site visually in a number of ways, where I can contribute.

I had underestimated the effort required to add and edit events to the database this week. I underestimated how long it could take to create a page with a form etc in a good way that works well and gives a good user experience. I'll continue to improve on this next week.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I feel like I have a sense of design that I can use to improve the visuals of the page, by both developing the frontend and reviewing others work.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
I have put in time expected from me this week and completed all of my work. I used the mid-week scrum meeting to ask for some help with the last bit on the second user story that was assigned to me which led to it being finished on time. I've also been good at reviewing other peoples code in the PRs on github. Maybe I could have thought about writing more user stories.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
I've been active in discussions within the team. I've been taking notes at the sprint review/retrospective sessions. I feel like I have done my part here.
