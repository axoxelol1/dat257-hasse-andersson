## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
I feel like I’ve improved a lot about the environment we are programing in. For instances, how to use github, vscode, branches etc efficiently. But I still have quite some more to learn in that area. I’d also like to excel my abilities in developing a satisfying front-end and the functions to do so. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
I Since I have quite some experience in writing reports and expressing the work I d, I feel like I’m able to learn others how to communicate in writing in a way that is easily accessible. I also feel like I’m able to contribute by learning others how to think about the questions we have at our team reflection. I feel like I’m good at teaching others how things we do during the project can be placed in the different questions, thereby learning how the things we do can be evaluated from a more holistic perspective. 

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
A I took a major part in planning our sprint and keep us on track with our deliveries. Since we’re approaching the end of the project we don’t have that much time left to carry out all of ou ideas for the project. I’ve made sure that we stick to the most important tasks and to have our stakeholders wishes in mind. Like previous week I contribute a lot to our team reflection.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
I was able to contribute by taking part in deciding on user stories for others as well as finishing the one I was assigned. Apart from I actively participated during all of our stand up meetings and during our sprint planning.
