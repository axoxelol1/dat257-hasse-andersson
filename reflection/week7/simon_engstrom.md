# Weekly reflection W4 - Simon Engstr√∂m 

## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
This week I feel that I have correctly estimated my user stories and issues that were delegated to me. I also learned some things helping out a team member in creating a nice looking navigation component.
I feel that I'm satisfied with my frontend knowledge for now but there is always room to improve. I can do this by continuing to work.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
Same as last week.
I feel like I have a sense of design that I can use to improve the visuals of the page, by both developing the frontend and reviewing others work.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
I have put in time expected from me this week and completed all of my work. I've been good at reviewing others work and I feel I've been able to contribute with good opinions.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
I've been active in discussions within the team. I've been taking notes at the sprint review/retrospective sessions. I feel like I have done my part here.
