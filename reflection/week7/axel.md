# Axel Larsson - Week 7

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
There is not much more to learn about now relating to the project. We will be focusing on getting rid of bugs and minor visual redesigns this week.
I want to learn to Rust but that is not really related to the project. To learn rust I will read the rust book.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week we can practice some presentation techniques, depending on what the presentation will look like. We will go to the lecture on wednesday
to learn more about the presentation.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I particiapted in our 2 stand up meetings and listented to our scrum master. I had also done work before so I could talk about that on the meeting.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I am paricipating in the team reflection as much as I am able to. I want to get better at writing the team reflections. I think the only way to improve
is practice, I will help writing the final report.
