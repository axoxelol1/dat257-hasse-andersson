# Week 7 personal reflection - Casper Lindh

## what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I learned to import other users react-packages to implement some of their functions. What I further want to build upon is understanding more of the underlying components and how they work together with the front-end. 

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Haven’t changed since last week. But further believe that I can help my team learn something new in the finalized report. I’ve had a lot of projects before and written a lot of reports previously. Also, the knowledge I’ve gained from the bachelor thesis will most likely come in handy.

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As a scrum master I contributed by conducting and leading scrum-meetings in order for the group to become more aware of the current situation of the project and to ensure an agile workflow. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I further developed the front-end to become more visually appealing to the user. First, I took some pictures of campus that I later implemented on a slide show that automatically switched pictures in the background and provided a much more ‘living’ feel for the site.
