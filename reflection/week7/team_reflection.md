## Customer value and scope
This sprint the applications major issues have been added and next sprint will be dedicated to fix the most bugs in relation to their priority. Value added is for a student at Chalmers and continuously examined for perceived value once each sprint. What remains is also to pay attention to the visual details and improve them since there are some inconsistencies as of now .

The task set for each user story has been met and all user stories added to the sprint except one has been merged. The not yet merged pull request only needs a fix in height and width of a background picture to fit mobile as well as desktop nicely.

The user-stories were nicely estimated and tasked respectively with the demanded functionality. This influenced the workflow and how value was created for the stakeholders.

We’ve ensured the DoD by testing the code using automatic build-testing. This was first taken in action a couple of sprints ago, and has been successful thus far. Automatic tests were performed and all were successful. 

Our KPI that reflects how many of our user stories are wrongly estimated each week is at an all time low (0 out of 6) and the sum of the user stories almost exactly matched the velocity which always is our aim, so that is great. 

## Application of scrum
As the project has advanced, we’ve become more familiar with the scrum methodology. We’ve established routines which have been useful for us, some of which are: sprint review/planning/reflection on mondays afternoon, two stand-up scrum meetings during the sprint. Some of the things brought up in regards to scrum have all been successful to this point and we’re planning on continuing with them. 

The product owner and the scrummaster have been successful in their tasks during this week. The PO has taken a major responsibility during the reviews by going through the product and evaluating it. This has helped us tremendously to focus on the most important tasks and to deliver a shippable product. The scrum master has played a vital part in ensuring we follow the scrum practice so that essential parts of the review, planning and reflection aren’t being left out. 

The way we’ve done pull-requests has been quite successful, but we still could improve on them. We ensure code standard and work flow by having at least two members reviewing each story. But we’ve encountered inefficiencies when changes to PR’s have been requested. During the times this has happened, it has taken quite some time to amend the requests.  

The supervision from TA’s has also helped us by always reminding us of the holistic picture. It has helped us in our way of thinking in regards to what we are doing but more importantly why we’re doing things.
