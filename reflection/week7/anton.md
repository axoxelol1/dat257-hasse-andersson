## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to become a better person.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel that everyone has found an efficient way to work independently, and find ways to solve our problems and learn new things by ourselves. Therefore, I think the significance of me personally helping the others has decreased over time.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I performed code reviews, participated during meetings, took part in conversations and worked on user stories. I have also created new user stories.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I added optional queries to the calendar API so that one can choose to only include events that are hosted by a certain group, or within a given timeframe.
