# Week 5 personal reflection - Casper Lindh

## what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I want to further develop my knowledge in statements from previous weeks. I feel like I haven’t truly understood tailwind and the implementation of front-end development, which is something I’m interested in learning more about.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I feel like this part haven’t changed from last weeks. I will continue to contribute as mentioned in previous chapters. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
The use of scrum this week has been lower than the previous week, since some group members has become sick, and the scrum meetings has not been able to be conducted as usual. As a scrum master I contributed by structuring and leading sprint review, sprint retrospective and sprint planning. 

## what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution this week has been co-developing a connection between back-end and front-end, more specifically connecting the database to the visuals of the website. Further I helped develop nicer visuals on the front-end to be more appealing and intuitive for users.
