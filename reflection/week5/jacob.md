## What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s use of Scrum?

**What I should be doing**: I finished my work a little to late and my team mates didn't have time to review my code.

**How I get there**: I was ill beginning if the week, and I'm better now, so it will be easier to finish my stories in time.
