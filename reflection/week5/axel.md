# Axel Larsson - Week 3

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I worked more on the search feature last week than expected so I did not have time to learn the .ics format. So that is still a goal this week, 
especially if we choose to work on exporting to calendar feature now.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since we are planning on having a mid-week meeting this week I hope to explain what I have learned about the .ics format and how 
we can use it in our project. I also want to be available under the week to help.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I am taking responsibility for communicating with our external stakeholder. I am also continously working with reviewing code in pull requests, and
keeping our project board up to date.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I am taking part in writing our team reflection during our sprint retrospective. This week I finished the search functionality.
