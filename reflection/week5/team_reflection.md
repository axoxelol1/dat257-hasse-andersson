# Hasse Andersson team reflection - Week 5 / Sprint 3

## Customer Value and Scope
According to our KPIs, we are still having a difficult time estimating the workload of user stories, but we 
are continuously trying to improve our estimates. At the moment, most of the user stories are being overestimated. 
We will try to improve on this in the following sprints and review our progress using our KPIs as we are right now. 
The velocity of this sprint matched the sum of the user stories' weight quite well, but as said the estimates were a bit high. 

We’ve been successful in meeting our milestones of certain sprints. For example, the main goal of this sprint was to display actual events.

We’ve been more consistent in setting up standards of how we work with our user stories, 
and how they are being merged into the sprint and later the main-branch. Another addition from last week was that 
we added the “waiting for review” column which is a step before marking it as done. During this phase, it is waiting to be 
reviewed by at least two other members. This has made it more clear when the actual code/edits are finished but also it is 
a great way for us to separate it from the done column, since at this point there are no more things to be made from it. 
This in turn helps our workflow which creates efficiency for the following sprints, resulting in more value for the customers.

We now provide quite a lot of value because even though the application is barebones it does what our external stakeholder expects it to. 
We can see events, search, and filter by different hosts. There are of course many more things we want to add but the baseline product is done.


## Social Contract and Effort
Our effort has continually grown as the group gets better at working together and we get more comfortable with the different aspects of our application. 
During the project we’ve evaluated the social contract and stuck with the things stated there. There have been instances of members not arriving at time, 
but when that has occurred we’ve been informative to the other members and also faced the consequences of the violation, namely fika-prick. 
This has most often occurred on Mondays, resulting in 5-15 minutes of postponements. Our social contract states that we should be on time 
and the team members who are late have to improve. 
There have been scheduling conflicts and other things during spare time that has prevented the amount of time spent on the project. 
The team are satisfied with the results thus far, but there is an overall agreement that more time should be spent on the project.

We updated our social contract during sprint 1 to reflect our communication through discord. It has improved our communication and all 
team members are checking the “important” text channel.

We want to try and work earlier in the week so that it is easier to have scrum meetings during the week and get progress updates and 
redistribute workload if needed. To try and achieve this we are scheduling a meeting on Thursday where everyone should have an update 
on what they have done and what is left. Daily scrums are hard to do because of schedule conflicts but we hope that our chat in combination 
with this meeting works well.
