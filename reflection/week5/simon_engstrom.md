# Weekly reflection W3 - Simon Engstr√∂m 

## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
This week I have been improving the backend by adding events from another source. I wanted to do some frontend so me and kurre took on one user story in the backend and one in the frontend collaboratively, although we ended up doing one of the user stories separate from each other, so no frontend for me this week. I still want to do this more next week to improve my frontend-skills.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
We added a requirement that at least two people have to approve a PR before you can merge it. And I have been quite good att reviewing them when they are created. Therefore I feel that I have contributed with my knowledge on a steady basis during the sprint. I plan on continuing to do so.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
I have been contributing to improving our workflow in github by setting restrictions on code reviews, mergeing and automated build testing. Although I need to get better at updating the scrum board when my user stories reach a new state. Ill try to do this more next week. Next week I'll try to write more user stories, I think the whole group needs to keep it in mind.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
Same as last week, I feel like I have contributed to the teams deliveries by supplying my opinions and contributing to discussions about the progress. I feel like I've done my part.
