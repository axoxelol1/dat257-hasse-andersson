## What do I want to learn or understand better?
One technology that we would like to use in our project is the ICS calendar format. This would allow us to create a custom calendar with the data from our website, so that users can subscribe to it. In order to achieve this we need to learn more about the format, which I want to do this week.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We continued as we've done previous weeks with starting the week by meeting at school and beginning with our user stories. I think this is a good thing, because getting started is often the most difficult part, so it is helpful to have someone else there who can help.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I performed code reviews, participated during meetings, took part in conversations and worked on user stories.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed by working on the frontend again. We connected the database so that we no longer have to mock the events, and we also worked on making the website more responsive.
