## What do I want to learn or understand better? 
I'd like to excel my skills in front end developing. The further we get to the finished product, the more isolated user stories become. While this is happening it creates more freedom and less dependencies, which creates opportunities for me to really dive in to certain functions and master them. I'm also still eager to learn more about the overall functions needed to combine different components of the code to contribute to the hollistics of the program. 

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
Apart from what has been stated in previous reflections, one of the ways in which I could help someone learn is by programming in pairs. In this way I'll be highly involved in finding solutions that the problems we face. I'd also like to take a larger role in reviewing others PR's and in that way bringing more feedback on others code.

## What's my contribution towards my team's use of scrum? 
During this week, I played a major part in setting up next sprint. I also helped a lot with writing our sprint review and retrospective, making sure we continuously document things that are being sad and also to highlight certain topics that otherwise would have been overlooked when evaluating the sprint. I also found a way for me and my team mate for two certain stories to work efficiently and in dividing tasks between us.

## What's my contribution towards my team's deliveries? 
I've played an active part in planning the sprints with different user stories and assigning tasks to everyone, including myself. I also made contributions in the database by creating a collection containing documents of hosts (committees) and updating the names in our code. By doing this I made sure they were all aligned and syncronized with each other.
